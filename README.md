# About the Project

Minha Trilha Academica (My Academic Path) is a full-stack web application developed during the 8th semester of the undergraduate program in Control and Automation Engineering at the Federal University of Santa Catarina. The project was led by me, Guilherme Takashiba, with contributions from the academic students Leonardo da Rosa and Matheus Neves, and external support from Engineer Guilherme Renkel.

The application is intended for internal use by undergraduates, serving as a tool for managing courses and providing a more refined curriculum control with graphical representations and numerical indications of each student's academic progress.

The ultimate goal of the application was to deploy it on a server so that students at the Federal University of Santa Catarina could use it in their daily activities. However, due to deadlines and bureaucratic processes from the educational institution, executing the app at the production level has not been possible yet. Nevertheless, by the end of the semester, a functional version was presented, running locally, as depicted in the images illustrating the app's functionality.
